4300,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it…"
4301,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
4302,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
4303,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
4304,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
4305,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
4306,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
4307,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
4308,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."

4325,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
4326,Meant to reply to this article:
4327,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.

4340,But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
4341,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.
4342,"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
4343,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
4344,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster

4351,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
4352,Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.

5215,"Hi, I'm Art Garfunkel. Have you heard the sound of silence? Because, you know, it makes a sound..."
5216,Raul Campos invited me to do a guest DJ gig on KCRW. Hear my random holiday season music selections at
5217,Yum! Even better than deep fried butter:
5218,"Yeah, this really is me, as my Mom will attest. Not sure I can handle just doing 140 char missives. Will put longer thoughts on G+"
5219,"Got called randomly by Kanye West today and received a download of his thoughts, ranging from shoes to Moses. He was polite, but opaque."
5220,His singing and acting talent will be sorely missed: South Park sequel coming soon...
5221,Why does the crowd cry over the glorious leader Kim Il Sung's death? Fear of being shot may play a role:
5222,Sam Harris also wrote a nice piece on the awesomeness of Hitchens: May the good man RIP.
5223,"Read ""Lying"", the new book by my friend Sam Harris. Excellent cover art and lots of good reasons not to lie!"
5224,Am reading a great biography of Ben Franklin by Isaacson. Highly recommended.
5225,That was a total non sequitur btw
5226,"Great Voltaire quote, arguably better than Twain. Hearing news of his own death, Voltaire replied the reports were true, only premature."
5227,I made the volume on the Model S go to 11. Now I just need to work in a miniature Stonehenge...
5228,"Went to Iceland on Sat to ride bumper cars on ice! No, not the country, Vlad's rink in Van Nuys. Awesome family fun :)"
5229,"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me."
5230,Excited to have Larry Ellison &amp; Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board!
5231,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
5232,"Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
5233,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
5234,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
5235,"There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"
5236,Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
5237,Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!
5238,Stainless Steel Starship
5239,At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
5240,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
5241,Engineering is true magic
5242,Please put “invented car fart” on my gravestone. This is my only request.
5243,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at or visit stores."
5244,"Anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector"
5245,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
5246,"As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha"
5247,"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
5248,Join our underground movement!
5249,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
5250,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
5251,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
5252,Next step for Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
5253,Presentation starting at 8:15
5254,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
5255,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
5256,"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
5257,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
5258,Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
5259,Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight
5260,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
5261,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
5262,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet"
5263,ramen is sooo good
5264,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
5265,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
5266,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
5267,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
5268,"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps."
5269,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."
5270,"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
5271,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
5272,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
5273,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
5274,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
5275,Falcon/Dragon launch to  Station in 9 minutes
5276,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
5277,64 satellites on this flight!
5278,None shall pass!
5279,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
5280,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games."
5281,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
5282,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work"
5283,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week"
5284,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then , , &amp; are the places to be."
5285,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"

5287,"If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America via"
5288,Signing off for a while
5289,Starships were meant to fly
5290,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
5291,Renaming BFR to Starship
5292,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
5293,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
5294,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
5295,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
5296,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
5297,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
5298,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
5299,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
5300,Listening to Better Now
5301,"Sure hope this isn’t true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
5302,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon 9 landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
5303,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for 3 min bulk discount.
5304,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
5305,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
5306,Not much but it is ours
5307,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
5308,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
5309,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
5310,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30
5311,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
5312,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
5313,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
5314,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
5315,"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …"
5316,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
5317,Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
5318,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship

5326,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
5327,We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
5328,Kids these days have it easy
5329,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.

5354,How’d they know!?
5355,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
5356,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."

5364,"Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
5365,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."
5366,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 &amp; super simple new order page"
5367,Love the Reddit comments too
5368,Dog saves her puppies
5369,Tomorrow brings a lemur
5370,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
5371,Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
5372,Insightful article by David

5388,First Falcon 9 land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!
5389,What they do should be illegal
5390,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
5391,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
5392,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
5393,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!

5408,"Btw, can’t emphasize enough how would not be where it is today without . Thank you."
5409,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
5410,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
5411,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"

5429,"Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. The Red and The Black"

5481,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
5482,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
5483,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
5484,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."

5513,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
5514,“No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Answer: That’s not funny!!
5515,"Heading back into the factory, so that’s enough for now. Don’t take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, it’s called a “Tweet”."
5516,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
5517,"Those who proclaim themselves “socialists” are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp; attended an expensive college. Fate loves irony."

5572,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
5573,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
5574,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
5575,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."

5603,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
5604,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
5605,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
5606,"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"

6313,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
6314,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."

6316,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."
6317,"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."

6322,Falcon/Dragon launch to  Station in 9 minutes
6323,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."

6338,Renaming BFR to Starship
6339,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
6340,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
6341,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
6342,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
6343,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
6344,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
6345,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
6346,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!

6356,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
6357,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30
6358,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
6359,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
6360,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
6361,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
6362,"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …"

6528,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
6529,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
6530,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."

6560,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
6561,“No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Answer: That’s not funny!!
6562,"Heading back into the factory, so that’s enough for now. Don’t take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, it’s called a “Tweet”."
6563,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
6564,"Those who proclaim themselves “socialists” are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp; attended an expensive college. Fate loves irony."
6565,Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. It’s pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by Douglas Adams &amp; Isaac Asimov.

6572,"19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…"

6606,My point exactly
6607,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."

6619,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
6620,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
6621,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
6622,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."

6634,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
6635,"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"

6650,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
6651,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
6652,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"

7289,Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
7290,"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week."
7291,Love reddit. Gandel gets shredded &amp; won't even answer top 3 upvoted questions. Some really funny comments about Koch
7292,"Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA, which is why ..."
7293,Tesla response to the misleading Fortune articles about Autopilot
7294,Sponsored articles …
7295,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)
7296,Our condolences for the tragic loss
7297,"My son recently asked what my favorite animal was. Well, of course …"
7298,Thoughtful analysis of the Tesla/SolarCity merger by

7301,This is going to be great
7302,"If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential :)"
7303,"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
7304,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side
7305,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation."
7306,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
7307,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
7308,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
7309,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
7310,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
7311,Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
7312,"Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
7313,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll
7314,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
7315,Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens
7316,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
7317,"Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
7318,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
7319,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on  BBCA
7320,Something about a flying metal suit...

7342,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
7343,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
7344,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
7345,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."

7352,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
7353,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
7354,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery"
7355,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
7356,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
7357,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
7358,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
7359,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy
7360,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
7361,Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
7362,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)
7363,By land and sea

7401,Tesla charger map
7402,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
7403,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this.
7404,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
7405,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
7406,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
7407,"Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks  Satellites for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions."
7408,. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign

7410,MIT Technology Review 2016
7411,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
7412,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
7413,Next gen Atlas robot
7414,"There is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%."
7415,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
7416,Just wanted to thank Stu G for Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
7417,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs

7419,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
7420,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
7421,This baby Model S really is quite fun
7422,More details on Model 3 unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
7423,No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
7424,Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
7425,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.

7429,"My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017"
7430,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it…"
7431,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
7432,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
7433,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
7434,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
7435,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
7436,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
7437,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
7438,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."
7439,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.

7455,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
7456,Meant to reply to this article:
7457,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.

9201,"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
9202,"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
9203,"Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"

9423,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."
9424,"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
9425,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
9426,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing

9429,Falcon/Dragon launch to  Station in 9 minutes
9430,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
9431,64 satellites on this flight!
9432,None shall pass!

9445,Renaming BFR to Starship
9446,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
9447,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
9448,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
9449,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
9450,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
9451,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
9452,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
9453,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
9454,Listening to Better Now

9463,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
9464,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30
9465,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
9466,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
9467,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
9468,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"

9636,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
9637,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."

9720,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
9721,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
9722,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
9723,"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"

9726,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
9727,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
9728,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
9729,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."

9741,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
9742,"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"

9758,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."

10331,Thoughtful Op-ed in Space News much appreciated
10332,Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.
10333,Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
10334,"Support &amp; advice from , , &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report.com."
10335,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
10336,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
10337,Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to end of weekend
10338,Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.

10372,Returning from Cape Canaveral to California...
10373,"Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket"
10374,Can't wait to see all three cores of Falcon Heavy come back for landings! First two will be almost simultaneous.
10375,Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
10376,Out on LZ-1. We just completed the post-landing inspection and all systems look good. Ready to fly again.

10411,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side
10412,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation."
10413,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
10414,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
10415,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
10416,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
10417,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
10418,Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

10441,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
10442,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
10443,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."

10449,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
10450,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
10451,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises

10461,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery"
10462,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
10463,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
10464,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
10465,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
10466,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy
10467,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.

10510,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this.
10511,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
10512,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
10513,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."

10522,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
10523,Just wanted to thank Stu G for Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
10524,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs
10525,"Worth watching ""Nathan for You"" on Comedy Central, particularly the ""Dumb Starbucks"" and ""Mechanic/Realtor"" episodes"
10526,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning

10528,This baby Model S really is quite fun
10529,More details on Model 3 unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
10530,No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
10531,Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
10532,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
10533,Love this Tesla video made by

10537,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it…"
10538,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
10539,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
10540,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
10541,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
10542,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
10543,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
10544,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
10545,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."
10546,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
10547,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions

10560,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
10561,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
10562,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
10563,Meant to reply to this article:
10564,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
10565,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
10566,Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence …
10567,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
10568,About 2 mins from static fire

10576,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
10577,But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
10578,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.
10579,"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
10580,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
10581,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
10582,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.

10586,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"
10587,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
10588,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
10589,Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
10590,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
10591,"Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
10592,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
10593,What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
10594,"Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important, CR says 97% of owners expect their next car to be a Tesla (the acid test)."
10595,Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
10596,Congrats on driving a Tesla from LA to NY in just over two days!

12162,"New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted &amp; demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet."
12163,Freedom Fridays …
12164,What should Twitter do next?
12165,Let that sink in …
12166,And … we just hit another all-time high in Twitter usage lol

12200,And I’m open to the idea of voting Democrat again in the future
12201,"To be clear, my historical party affiliation has been Independent, with an actual voting history of entirely Democrat until this year"
12202,"Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who’s in charge!"
12203,"To independent-minded voters:Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic."
12204,"But if Twitter is bird, that’s means … 🤯"
12205,Back when birds were real
12206,How times have changed
12207,"Twitter rules will evolve over time, but they’re currently the following:"
12208,"My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk"
12209,Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That’s our mission.
12210,Widespread verification will democratize journalism &amp; empower the voice of the people
12211,Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
12212,"Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning. This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue."

12214,Search within Twitter reminds me of Infoseek in ‘98! That will also get a lot better pronto.

12218,Power to the People
12219,"Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required."
12220,"Again, to be crystal clear, Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.In fact, we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press."
12221,Excellent summary of Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety from the head of the team
12222,"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America."
12223,Tiny talk is talk so small it feels like it’s coming from your own mind
12224,Why is small talk even legal!?
12225,A neuron doesn’t realize it’s a neuron
12226,… with a lot of room for improvement
12227,"Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic super-intelligence"
12228,Advertisers should support:
12229,Twitter is simply the most interesting place on the Internet. That’s why you’re reading this tweet right now.
12230,Being attacked by both right &amp; left simultaneously is a good sign
12231,you get what you pay for
12232,Twitter speaks to the inner masochist in all of us
12233,Totally stole idea of charging for insults &amp; arguments from Monty Python tbh
12234,"To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8"
12235,"There will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure, which is already the case for politicians"
12236,This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators
12237,And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us
12238,"You will also get:- Priority in replies, mentions &amp; search, which is essential to defeat spam/scam- Ability to post long video &amp; audio- Half as many ads"
12239,Price adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity
12240,Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit. Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.
12241,Falcon Heavy launch in ~30 mins

12251,Fresh baked bread &amp; pastries are some of the great joys of life
12252,"To be super clear, we have not yet made any changes to Twitter’s content moderation policies"
12253,Ligma Johnson had it coming
12254,Comedy is now legal on Twitter
12255,Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.
